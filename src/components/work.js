          While most of my work experience involves either coaching or
          hospitality, I have been involved in creative pursuits since high
          school. Iâ€™m excited to launch into a coding career where I can
          leverage not only my creative skills but also the leadership and
          teamwork skills I developed as a coach and team member. My
          communication skills include project and people dynamics, customer
          service, and presenting/entertaining. I thrive in innovative
          environments where everyone is encouraged to be themselves and do
          their best work.
